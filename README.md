# stigler_diet
In this project I use the simplex algorithm for optimising the cost of a diet 
while meeting recommended daily intake of nutrients.

In stigler_diet.ipynb I solve Stigler's Diet problem to reproduce Dantzig's 
earlier results and show how the simplex algorithm is used in this context.

In irish_diet.ipynb I use the algorithm to optimise a diet consisting of foods 
commonly found in an Irish food basket and with updated nutritional info.

Supporting documents for reference are in the documents folder.

All databases used are in the data folder.
